# Proposal outline
Potential research questions:
* Extratropical Cyclones
  - How to better predict precipitation type in winter storms?
  - Better understand the process of cyclogenesis and where it will happen?
* Urban Meteorology
  - What are the projected changes to the UHI effect due to climate change?
  - Best ways to reduce and clear out air pollution in urban areas?
  - How does the built environment affect precipitation patterns in a high density urban area?
  -
